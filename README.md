# *X*ovich Java Edition

So I decided to recreate [*X*ovich](https://github.com/Zishan-Rahman/xovich) in JavaFX as a Gradle and Java programming exercise.

I still haven't written many unit tests for this because I'm struggling to get them recognised by Gradle for some reason. The test file (with a tiny dummy test checking for no exceptions) *probably* runs, but the report afterwards doesn't get built, and I don't know why. Ah, well. I'll need to look into this later. I'll make a relevant announcement on my website soon.

## TODO

- [ ] Get exisiting unit test to compile, run and have testing report built.
- [ ] If the above is successful, write more unit tests.
